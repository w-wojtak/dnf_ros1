## DNF Cognitive Architecture with Object Detection

This repository contains a cognitive architecture based on Dynamic Neural Fields (DNF) with real-time object detection using ZED camera and YOLO.
System Overview

The system consists of:

    Object Detection - ZED camera + YOLO object detection (runs in Python virtual environment)
    DNF Learning - Dynamic Neural Field model for learning sequences
    DNF Recall - Dynamic Neural Field model for recalling learned sequences
    Input/Output Processing - Nodes for handling inputs and outputs

### Prerequisites

    Ubuntu 20.04
    ROS Noetic
    Python 3.8+
    CUDA-capable GPU
    ZED Camera and SDK
    PyTorch
